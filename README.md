## App Idea
App Idea: Campaign

Campaign is a financial literacy and trading insights app built to empower minority communities, especially Black traders. 
The goal is to make financial education accessible, break down barriers to wealth-building, and create a space where people can learn, 
grow, and build together. The app will include lessons on personal finance, investing, and trading, with a focus on real-world application. 
Users can join discussions, get insights from experienced traders, and connect with mentors. There will also be live Q&As, market breakdowns, 
and challenges to keep learning engaging. At its core, Campaign is about building financial confidence, fostering community, and 
making sure we all have the tools to create generational wealth.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- The only challenge was getting accustomed to the XCode GUI/Interface. I thought the project was fun and I learned a lot.
